    This app is hardwired for 3 modes named Day, Evening, and Night (easily changed).
    Edit lines 114 and 120 to change the 3 modes used in the app.
    The dim levels for all 3 modes are entered as a single 6 digit number, e.g. 903510,
    which would give 90 for Day, 35 for Evening, and 10 for Night (or corresponding modes).
    The app also allows you to specify additional dimmers that are turned off
    when the master dimmer is turned off.  The app has similar functionality to 
    Dim With Me, in that there is a master dimmer and some slave dimmers. The
    idea for that is that sometimes the master dimmer physical switch is used to
    turn on the lights -- the slaves follow, or likewise to turn off some lights.  That's
    how I use it, for a master off for an entire area, encompassing more than would be turned on.
    
    It should be noted that for this to work, one must use an instant reporting z-wave dimmer.
    One such dimmer is the Leviton VRMX1 (which must be included directly to the hub to have instant).
    
    If motion sensors(s) are specified they turn on the master and all slaves to the 
    current mode's dimmer level.  The motion activation can be conditioned on times of day,
    days of week, or modes.  Other sensors can be used for turning off after x minutes.
    
    The app adjusts dimmer levels on each mode change to one of the three hardwired modes.
    A mode change to some other mode has no effect on the dimmer levels, which allows for
    extra modes that can be used to disable motion entirely at times. For an instance of the
    app without motion, if the lights are off at mode change, the app will adjust their
    dimmer levels using a modified device type.  This is so that the next time
    the lights are turned on using the physical switch, they come on to the right level.  
    Without this feature, the light would come on to its previous dimmer level, and then
    adjust the level once ST sees the lights-on event.  This can be a number of seconds 
    after the physical switch is pressed.  What you don't want is for someone to go into
    the bathroom in the middle of the night, turn on a switch, and have the light come on
    bright for a few seconds before it dims to the correct level.
    
    There is one more feature of this app that has to do with someone manually changing the
    dimmer level.  For example, in the evening, a woman wants to put on makeup and the light
    isn't bright enough.  She turns up the dimmer.  That event is responded to by temporarily
    adjusting the dimmer level for both master and slaves to that new level.  Once the light is turned off, 
    the dimmer levels will be restored to their mode-specific settings.
